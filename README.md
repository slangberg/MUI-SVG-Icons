# MUI-SVG-Icons

Template to create icons for MUI 5 using the included `createSvgIcon` util from the '@mui/material/utils' library and the SVGR cli.


## What Does this Repo Demonstrate

This repo is set to covert any svgs included in `./svgs` folder into the `<SvgIcon/>` component included in the MUI library. These generated icons will use the same API as the native component
